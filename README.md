# **100-Day DSA Challenge**

Welcome to the **100-Day DSA Challenge** repository! This challenge is designed to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) over the next 100 days, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics. It’s perfect for beginners, interview prep, and those looking to enhance their problem-solving skills.

## **Introduction**

The **100-Day DSA Challenge** will help you:
- Build strong foundations in DSA
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Improve your ability to write optimized code
- Prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies

Each day, a new concept will be introduced, followed by practice problems to reinforce learning. You’ll be tackling real-world problems, learning optimization techniques, and building your skills day by day.

## **Why DSA?**

Data Structures and Algorithms are at the core of every technical interview and are essential for:
- Writing efficient and optimized code
- Cracking interviews at top companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook
- Understanding how data is processed and manipulated by computers
- Improving problem-solving speed and efficiency

## **How This Repository is Structured**

The repository contains folders for each day of the challenge, with each folder containing:
- **Theory**: Explanation of the day's topic
- **Problems**: A set of problems to solve based on the day's topic
- **Solutions**: Code solutions for each problem (in multiple languages, if possible)

### **Folder Structure:**
```
Day_1/
│
├── theory.md         # Explanation of the topic
├── problems.md       # List of practice problems
└── solutions/
    ├── solution1.java  # Solution to Problem 1 in Java
    └── solution2.js    # Solution to Problem 2 in JavaScript
```

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-Day-DSA-Challenge.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Coding Environment**:  
   Make sure you have accounts on platforms like **LeetCode**, **CodeChef**, or **GeeksforGeeks** to practice problems and track progress.

3. **Start Day 1**:  
   Begin with Day 1 and follow along with the theory and problems. Don’t forget to check the solution folder after attempting the problems!

## **Challenge Structure**

The challenge is broken down into the following sections:

- **Days 1-20**: Core Fundamentals (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hashing)
- **Days 21-40**: Sorting & Searching Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search)
- **Days 41-60**: Advanced Data Structures (Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries)
- **Days 61-80**: Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms
- **Days 81-100**: Final Preparations (Advanced Algorithm Techniques, Mock Interviews)

Each day will introduce a new concept with explanations, implementation, and coding challenges. At the end of the challenge, you’ll have a solid grasp on key DSA concepts and be well-prepared for interviews.

## **Contributing**

This repository is open for contributions! If you find any issues, bugs, or have additional resources to add, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. Contributions could include:
- New problems or challenges
- Improved explanations in the theory sections
- Additional solutions in various languages
